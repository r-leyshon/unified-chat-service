# Minimal Pomodoro — Getting Started

## What is it?

Minimal Pomodoro is a simple timer that alternates between **work** and **break** periods. You work for a set time (e.g. 25 minutes), then take a short break. After several work blocks, you get a longer break. No accounts, no sync—just a timer in your browser or on your device.

## Quick start

1. Open the app. The first work period starts (or is ready to start) with the default duration.
2. Press **Start** to begin the work timer. When it reaches zero, you get a short break.
3. When the break ends, the next work period is ready. Repeat as needed.
4. After a set number of work sessions (e.g. 4), the app offers a **long break** instead of a short one.

That’s it. No sign-up required.

## Default durations

| Phase       | Default | What it’s for                    |
|------------|---------|-----------------------------------|
| Work       | 25 min  | Focused work block                |
| Short break| 5 min   | Rest between work blocks          |
| Long break | 15 min  | Longer rest after several blocks  |

You can change these in **Settings** (if the app includes a settings screen). If not, the defaults are fixed.

## How cycles work

- One **work** period + one **short break** = one cycle.
- After a set number of cycles (e.g. 4), the next “break” is a **long break**.
- Then the cycle count resets and you go back to short breaks until you complete another set of work blocks.

Example: Work 25 → Break 5 → Work 25 → Break 5 → Work 25 → Break 5 → Work 25 → **Long break 15** → repeat.

## Pause and reset

- **Pause** — Stops the timer. Resume from the same time.
- **Reset** — Stops and restarts the current phase from the full duration (e.g. 25:00 again). The cycle count (short vs long break) is not reset by this.

## Notifications and sound

When a phase ends, the app can show a browser or system notification and play a short sound (if you’ve allowed it). This is optional and can usually be turned off in settings or browser permissions.

## FAQ

**Can I skip a break?**  
If the app has a “Skip” or “Next” control, you can move to the next phase. Otherwise, let the break run or reset to start work again.

**Does it work offline?**  
Yes. Once loaded, the timer runs locally. No account or server is required.

**Where is my progress stored?**  
In the minimal version, progress is not stored. Refreshing the page typically resets to the start of a work period. Future versions may add optional local storage.

**Why 25 minutes?**  
The classic Pomodoro Technique uses 25-minute work blocks. You can change the duration in settings if the app allows it.
