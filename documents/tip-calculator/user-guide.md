# Tip Calculator — User Guide

## What it does

The Tip Calculator helps you work out how much to leave as a tip and how to split the total fairly between people. You enter the bill total, choose a tip percentage, and say how many people are sharing. The app shows the tip amount, the total including tip, and each person’s share.

## Step-by-step

### 1. Enter the bill total

Type the bill amount in the main field. Use numbers and one decimal point only (e.g. `42.50`). Do not use currency symbols; the app assumes your local currency.

### 2. Choose the tip percentage

Pick one of the preset tip options (e.g. 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%) or use the custom field to enter any whole number. The total tip and the final amount update as you change this.

### 3. Set the number of people

Enter how many people are splitting the bill. Each person’s share is the full total (bill + tip) divided by this number.

### 4. Read the results

- **Tip amount** — Total tip for the whole bill.
- **Total** — Bill + tip.
- **Per person** — Total divided by the number of people (split evenly).

---

## Rounding

Amounts are shown to two decimal places. Per-person amounts are rounded to the nearest cent so that the sum of everyone’s share matches the total as closely as possible.

---

## Split evenly

The app always splits the total equally. If someone had a smaller meal or shared less, you’ll need to adjust outside the app. There is no “split by item” or “custom share” feature.

## Tips

- Use **custom %** for service that was a bit more or less than the presets.
- For large groups, the per-person amount makes it easy to collect the right total.
- If the bill already includes service, set tip to 0% to see only the split of the existing total.
