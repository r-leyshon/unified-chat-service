UNIT CONVERTER — REFERENCE
==========================

OVERVIEW
--------
The Unit Converter converts values between units in one category at a time. You enter a number, choose the "from" unit, choose the "to" unit, and the app shows the converted value. One category (e.g. length or weight) is supported per session.

HOW TO USE
----------
1. Select a category (Length, Weight, or Volume).
2. Enter the value to convert. Use numbers and one decimal point. No spaces or units in this field.
3. Choose the "From" unit (the unit your value is in).
4. Choose the "To" unit (the unit you want the result in).
5. The result appears automatically. No button required in the basic version.

PRECISION
---------
Results are shown to a sensible number of decimal places (usually 2–6 depending on size). Very large or very small numbers may be shown in scientific notation.

SUPPORTED UNITS (LENGTH)
------------------------
Metres (m), Kilometres (km), Miles (mi), Feet (ft), Inches (in), Centimetres (cm), Yards (yd), Millimetres (mm).

SUPPORTED UNITS (WEIGHT)
------------------------
Kilograms (kg), Grams (g), Pounds (lb), Ounces (oz), Stone (st), Milligrams (mg).

SUPPORTED UNITS (VOLUME)
------------------------
Litres (L), Millilitres (mL), Gallons (gal), US Gallons (gal US), Fluid ounces (fl oz), Cups (cup), Tablespoons (tbsp), Teaspoons (tsp).

LIMITS
------
- Maximum input length: 15 characters (including decimal point).
- Only one category can be used at a time. To convert across categories (e.g. volume to weight), use a separate tool or lookup density.

FUTURE
------
Planned: temperature (C, F, K), and possibly "copy result" and "swap units" buttons.
